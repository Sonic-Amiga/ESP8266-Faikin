# WeMos D1-Mini

Some users are successfully running Faikin-8266 on a stock WeMos D1-Mini board, available worldwide.
ESP8266 is officially 5V-tolerant, so it can be connected to the AC directly.

!!! Note that ** THESE BOARDS USE 5V POWER**, and higher voltage (e. g. 12V) may be present on the connector !!!
Triple-check your voltages and pinouts !!!
